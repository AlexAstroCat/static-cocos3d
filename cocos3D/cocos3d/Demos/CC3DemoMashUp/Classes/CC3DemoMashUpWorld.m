 * property of the materials underlying the node).
 *
 * In addition, if it is the beach ball that the user touched, toggle it between
 * translucent and fully opaque by simply setting the isOpqaue property on the beach ball.
 * If either the textured or rainbow teapots is selected, toggle the display of a wire-frame
 * of the node's bounding box.
 *
 * If the ground plane is touched, the ground plane node is not highlighted. Instead, an orange
 * teapot is dropped at the location of the touch. This demonstrates the ability to drop objects
 * into the 3D world using touch events.
