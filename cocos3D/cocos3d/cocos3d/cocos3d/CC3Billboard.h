/**
 * This CC3Node displays a 2D cocos2D CCNode at the projectedPosition of this node.
 * Since the  cocos2D node is displayed in 2D, it always appears to face the camera,
 * and it is never occluded by any 3D objects.
 *
 * CC3Billboards are useful for drawing a label, health-bar, or some other 2D artifact
 * on or near the projected position of a 3D object, and have that 2D artifact
 * apparently move along with the 3D object as it moves through the 3D world.
 *
 * CC3Billboard is a type of CC3Node, and can therefore participate in a structural
 * node assembly. An instance can be the child of another node, and the billboard
 * itself can have child nodes.
 *
 * The size of the 2D node can be automatically scaled based on the distance between
 * the 3D billboard node and the 3D camera. Doing so will keep the 2D artifact at the
 * same proportional size to the 3D object, as the 3D object moves toward or away from
 * the camera.
 * 
 * This dyanamic scaling of the 2D artifact is the default behaviour. To fix the 2D
 * artifact to a single static scale, set both the minimumBillboardScale and
 * minimumBillboardScale properties to the same non-zero value.
 *
 * Generally, CC3Billboards return NO for the hasLocalContent property, and are not
 * drawn along with other nodes that do have local content. Instead, CC3Billboards
 * are drawn by the CC3World after all 3D drawing has been completed. To do this,
 * the CC3World invokes the draw2dWithinBounds: method on each CC3Billboard instance.
 *
 * A CC3Billboard can, and should, have a bounding volume, but the bounding volume
 * must be an instance of a subclass of CC3NodeBoundingArea, because the boundary
 * is tested against the viewport instead of the camera frustum. The default bounding
 * volume is an instance of CC3BillboardBoundingBoxArea, which tests for overlap
 * between the bounding box of the CC3Layer and the boundingBox of the enclosed
 * 2D CCNode instance.

/**
 * Returns whether the local content of this node intersects the given bounding rectangle.
 * This check does not include checking children, only the local content.
 *
 * This method is called during the drawing operations of each frame to determine whether
 * this node should be culled from the visible nodes and not drawn. A return value of YES
 * will cause the node to be drawn, a return value of NO will cause the node to be culled
 * and not drawn.
 *
 * Culling nodes that are not visible to the camera is an important performance enhancement.
 * The node should strive to be as accurate as possible in returning whether it intersects
 * the viewport. Incorrectly returning YES will cause wasted processing within the GL engine.
 * Incorrectly returning NO will cause a node that should at least be partially visible to
 * not be drawn.
 *
 * In this implementation, if this node has a boundingVolume, this method delegates to it.
 * Otherwise, it simply returns YES. Subclasses may override to change this standard behaviour.
