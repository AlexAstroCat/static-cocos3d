/**
 * Bounding volumes are used by CC3Nodes to determine whether a node interset the camera's
 * frustum, or to determine boundaries for collision detection during physics simulation.
 * Many different shapes of boundaries are available, including points, spheres, bounding
 * boxes, etc, permitting tradeoffs between accuracy and computational processing time.
 *
 * This base bounding volume is simply a single point. When applied to a node, it indicates
 * that the node intersects the frustum if the node's center of geometry is within the frustum.
 *
 * For meshes, the center of geometry is calculated from the vertex locations. For other nodes,
 * it can be set directly within the bounding volume via the centerOfGeometry property.
