/**
 * CC3Camera represents the camera viewing the 3D world.
 *
 * CC3Camera is a type of CC3Node, and can therefore participate in a structural node assembly.
 * An instance can be the child of another node, and the camera itself can have child nodes.
 * For example, a camera can be mounted on a boom object or truck, and will move along with
 * the parent node. Or the camera node itself might have a light node attached as a child,
 * so that the light will move along with the camera, and point where the camera points.
 *
 * CC3Camera is also a type of CC3TargettingNode, and can be pointed in a particular
 * direction, or can be made to track a target node as that node moves, or the camera moves.
 *
 * The camera can be configured for either perspective or parallel projection, using
 * the isUsingParallelProjection property. By default, the camera will use perspective
 * projection.
 *
 * You can use the projectLocation: and projectNode: methods to project global locations
 * within the 3D world into 2D view coordinates, indicating where on the screen a 3D
 * object appears.
 *
 * You can use the unprojectPoint: and unprojectPoint:ontoPlane: methods to project a
 * 2D screen position into either a ray (a line) in the 3D world, or into a specific 
 * intersection location on a 3D plane.
 *
 * Scaling a camera is a null operation because it scales everything, including the size
 * of objects, but also the distance from the camera to those objects. The effects cancel
 * out, and visually it appears that nothing has changed.
 *
 * Therefore, for cameras, the scale and uniformScale properties are not applied to the
 * transform matrix. Instead, the uniformScale property acts as a zoom factor (as if the
 * camera lens is zoomed in or out), and influences the fieldOfView property accordingly.
 * See the description of the fieldOfView property for more information about zooming.
 *
 * If you find that objects in the periphery of your view appear elongated, you can adjust
 * the fieldOfView and/or uniformScale properties to reduce this "fish-eye" effect.
 * See the notes of the fieldOfView property for more on this.

 * Once a nominal field of view has been set in this property, changing the scale or
 * uniformScale properties will change the effective field of view accordingly (although
 * the value of the fieldOfView property remains the same). Scales greater than one zoom in
 * (objects appear larger), and scales between one and zero zoom out (objects appear smaller).
 *
 * Like real-world cameras, larger values for fieldOfView can sometimes result in a
 * "fish-eye" effect, where objects at the periphery of the view can appear elongated.
 * To reduce this effect, lower the value of fieldOfView property, or increase the value
 * of the uniformScale property. In doing so, you may need to move your camera further

 *
 * The specified location should be in global coordinates. If you are invoking this

 * of the node. For objects that are moving, the updated globalLocation is available in the

 *
 * The Z-component of the returned location indicates the distance from the camera to the

 *
 * Any 3D world location can be either in front of or behind the camera, and both cases will

 * objects into the 3D world at a location under user finger touch control.

 * Any object that lies anywhere along the ray in 3D space will appear at the
 * specified 2D point on the view. If you are trying to place an object at a 3D
 * location corresponding to the 2D view point (eg- a finger touch point), you
 * need to choose a specific location on the returned ray.

 * activities such as dropping objects onto the plane at a location under user finger
 * touch control.
 *
 * The returned result is a 4D vector, where the x, y & z components give the intersection
 * location in 3D space, and the w component gives the distance from the camera to the
 * intersection location. If the w component is negative, the intersection point is behind
 * the camera, which is an indication that the camera is looking away from the plane.
 *
 * If the ray from the camera through the specified point is parallel to the plane, no
 * intersection occurs, and the returned 4D vector will be zeroed (equal to kCC3Vector4Zero).
 *
 * You should therefore test the w component value to make sure it is positive and
 * non-zero before proceeding with an activity such as dropping an object on the plane.
 * If the plane has bounds in your world, you should also check whether the returned
 * intersection is within those bounds.
