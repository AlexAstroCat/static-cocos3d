/**
 * CC3Layer is a cocos2d CCLayer that supports full 3D rendering in combination with normal
 * cocos2d 2D rendering. It forms the bridge between the 2D and 3D drawing environments.
 *
 * The CC3Layer contains an instance of CC3World, and delegates all 3D operations, for both
 * updating and drawing 3D models, to the CC3World instance.
 *
 * In addition, like any cocos2d CCLayer, 2D child CCNodes can be added to this layer and
 * will be rendered either over or under the 3D world, based on their individual Z-order.
 * In particular, 2D controls such as menus, sprites, labels, health bars, joysticks, etc,
 * can be overlayed on the 3D world simply by adding them as children of this layer.
 * Similarly, a 2D backdrop could be rendered behind the 3D world by adding an appropriate
 * CCNode as a child with a negative Z-order.
 *
 * CC3Layer descends from CCLayerColor, and will draw a colored background behind both 2D
 * and 3D content if configured with a background color. When using 3D objects that use
 * alpha-blending, keep in mind that the background color does not participate in
 * alpha-blending with 3D models that are drawn over it. The background color will not show
 * through any semi-transparent 3D objects. See also the discussion below about translucent
 * objects when using touch events to select 3D nodes.
 *
 * To make use of the standard cocos2d model updatating functionality to update and animate
 * the 3D world, use the scheduleUpdate or schedule:interval: methods of CC3Layer to invoke
 * periodic callbacks to the update: method of the CC3Layer instance. The update: method
 * forwards these callbacks to the CC3World instance held by the CC3Layer.
 *
 * To enable touch event handling for this layer, set the isTouchEnabled property to YES.
 * Once enabled, touch events will automatically be forwarded to the CC3World to support
 * user selection of 3D nodes via touches. For more information on handling 3D node
 * selections, see the description of the method nodeSelected:byTouchEvent:at: of CC3World.
 *
 * Since the touch-move events are both voluminous and seldom used, the implementation
 * of ccTouchMoved:withEvent: has been left out of the default CC3Layer implementation.
 * To receive and handle touch-move events for object picking, copy the commented-out
 * ccTouchMoved:withEvent: template method implementation in CC3Layer to your customized
 * CC3Layer subclass.
 *
 * Selection of 3D nodes using touch events uses a color-picking algorithm. When a touch
 * event occurs, the 3D scene is drawn in pure colors behind the scenes and then drawn in
 * its full glory over top. Since the full scene is redrawn as it should be before being
 * displayed, the user sees no visible difference.
 *
 * However, since the CC3Layer's background color and any background 2D nodes have already
 * been drawn by normal cocos2d CCLayer behaviour and cannot be redrawn during 3D drawing,
 * when a touch event is used to select a node, there is a very slight flicker on any
 * translucent nodes that have nothing behind them except the layer's background color or
 * 2D CCNodes. Opaque 3D nodes are not affected and do not flicker. Nor do translucent nodes
 * that have 3D nodes behind them.
 *
 * To remove this flicker on translucent nodes during touch event processing, make sure that
 * translucent nodes do not appear directly over the background color of the layer, or over
 * 2D CCNodes. In such cases, use a full 3D skybox in the 3D world instead.
 *
 * CC3Layer directly descends from ControllableCCLayer, which means that it can optionally
 * be controlled by a CCNodeController instance. Doing so enables two features:
 *   - Automatic rotatation the layer (both the 2D and 3D components) when the device
 *     orientation changes.
 *   - The CC3Layer can be overlaid on a device camera image stream so that both the 2D and
 *     3D worlds can participate in an augmented reality view perspective.
 *
 * With the CCNodeController attached, either or both of these features can be turned on
 * or off. If neither of these features is required, there is no need to instantiate and
 * attach a CCNodeController, and the CC3Layer can be used without it.
 *
 * For most applications, you will create subclasses of both CC3Layer and CC3World.
 * The customized subclass of CC3World manages the behaviour of the 3D resources.
 * The customized subclass of CC3Layer manages the 2D artifacts, such as menus, sprites,
 * labels, health bars, joysticks, etc, that you want to overlay on the 3D scene.
 *
 * Typically, you will create a separate instance of CC3World for each 3D scene. You can also
 * create a distinct CC3Layer for each scene as well, or reuse a single CC3Layer instance
 * across multiple CC3World scenes by simply assigning a differnt CC3World instance to the layer.
 * 
 * To create and use your CC3Layer and CC3World pair, follow these steps:
 *   -# Instantiate your CC3World class, including creating or loading 3D file resources
 *      in the initializeWorld method.
 *   -# Instantiate your CC3Layer subclass, adding any 2D controls in the initializeControls method.
 *   -# Attach your CC3World to the cc3World property of your CC3Layer.
 *   -# Invoke the play method of your CC3World to enable dynamic behaviour for the 3D world.
 *   -# Schedule regular updates in your CC3Layer instance by invoking either the
 *      scheduleUpdate or schedule:interval: method.
 *   -# Optionally create a CCNodeController.
 *   -# Run your CC3Layer instance either by invoking the runSceneOnNode: method of the
 *      CCNodeController with your CC3Layer, or by wrapping your CC3Layer in a CCScene
 *      and invoking the runWithScene: method of the shared CCDirector instance.

/**
 * This method is invoked periodically when the components in the CC3World are to be updated.
 *
 * The dt argument gives the interval, in seconds, since the previous update.
 *
 * This implementation forwards this update to the updateWorld: method of the contained

 * this layer, but should be sure to invoke this superclass implementation, or to invoke
 * updateWorld: on the cc3World directly.
 *
 * Typcially this method is scheduled to be invoked automatically at a periodic interval by
 * using the scheduleUpdate or schedule:interval: methods of this instance, but may also be
 * invoked by some other periodic operation, or even directly by the application.
 *
 * This method is invoked asynchronously to the frame rendering animation loop, to keep the
 * processing of model updates separate from OpenGL ES drawing.
