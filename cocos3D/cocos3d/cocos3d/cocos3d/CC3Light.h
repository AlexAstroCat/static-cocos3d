/**
 * CC3Light represents the light in the 3D world.
 *
 * CC3Light is a type of CC3Node, and can therefore participate in a structural node assembly.
 * An instance can be the child of another node, and the light itself can have child nodes.
 * For example, a light can be mounted on a boom object or camera, and will move along with
 * the parent node.
 *
 * CC3Light is also a type of CC3TargettingNode, and can be pointed so that it shines in a
 * particular direction, or can be made to track a target node as that node moves.
 *
 * To turn a CC3Light on or off, set the visible property.
 *
 * The maximum number of lights available is determined by the platform. That number can
 * be retrieved from [CC3OpenGLES11Engine engine].platform.maxLights.value. All platforms
 * support at least eight lights.
 *
 * If the application uses lights in the 2D world as well, the indexes of those lights can
 * be reserved by invoking the class method setLightPoolStartIndex:. Light indexes reserved
 * for use by the 2D world will not be used by the 3D world.
