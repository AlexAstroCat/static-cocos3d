/** 
 * CC3Material manages information about a material that is used to cover one or more meshes.
 * This includes:
 *   - color
 *   - texture
 *   - interaction with lighting
 *   - opacity, translucency, and blending with background objects
 *
 * CC3Material supports two levels of control for blending and translucency:
 *   - To achieve the highest level of detail, accuracy and realism, you can individually
 *     set the explicit ambientColor, diffuseColor, specularColor, emissiveColor, shininess,
 *     sourceBlend, and destinationBlend properties. This suite of properties gives you the
 *     most complete control over the appearance of the material and its interaction with
 *     lighting conditions and the colors of the objects behind it, allowing you to generate
 *     rich visual effects. In addition, the isOpaque property sets the most commonly used
 *     blending combinations, and can be used to simplify your management of blending opaque
 *     or transparent materials, while still providing fine control of the ambient, diffuse
 *     and specular coloring.
 *   - At a simpler level, CC3Material also supports the cocos2d <CCRGBAProtocol> protocol.
 *     You can use the color and opacity properties of this protocol to set the most commonly
 *     used coloring and blending characteristics simply and easily. Setting the color property
 *     changes both the ambient and diffuse colors of the material in tandem. Setting the
 *     opacity property also automatically sets the source and destination blend functions to
 *     appropriate values for the opacity level. By using the color and opacity properties,
 *     you will not be able to achieve the complexity and realism that you can by using the
 *     more detailed properties, but you can achieve good effect with much less effort.
 *     And by supporting the <CCRGBAProtocol> protocol, the coloring and translucency of nodes
 *     with materials can be changed using standard cocos2d CCTint and CCFade actions, making
 *     it easier for you to add dynamic coloring effects to your nodes.
 * 
 * Each CC3MeshNode instance references an instance of CC3Material. Many CC3MeshNode
 * instances may reference the same instance of CC3Material, allowing many objects to
 * be covered by the same material.
 *
 * When being drawn, the CC3MeshNode invokes the draw method on the CC3Material
 * instance prior to drawing the associated mesh.
 *
 * When drawing the material to the GL engine, this class remembers which material was
 * last drawn, and only binds the material data to the GL engine when a different material
 * is drawn. This allows the application to organize the CC3MeshNodes within the CC3World
 * so that nodes using the same material are drawn together, before moving on to other
 * materials. This strategy can minimize the number of mesh switches in the GL engine,
 * which improves performance.
