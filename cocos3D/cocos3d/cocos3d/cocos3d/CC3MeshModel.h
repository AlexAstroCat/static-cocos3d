/**
 * A CC3MeshModel holds the 3D mesh for a CC3MeshNode. The CC3MeshNode enapsulates a reference
 * to the CC3MeshModel.
 *
 * In 3D models, the mesh model generally remains fixed, and transformations such as translation,
 * rotation, and scaling are applied at the node level. A single CC3MeshModel instance, which
 * typically contains a large set of data points, can be used by many nodes simultaneously,
 * and each node instance can be transformed, colored, and textured independently.
 *
 * With this in mind, and following best practices to consevere memory and processing time,
 * you should strive to create only one CC3MeshModel instance for each distinct mesh in your
 * application, and assign that single CC3MeshModel instance to any number of separate
 * CC3MeshNode instances that make use of it.
 *
 * When drawing the mesh to the GL engine, this class remembers which mesh was last drawn
 * and only binds the mesh data to the GL engine when a different mesh is drawn. This allows
 * the application to organize the CC3MeshNodes within the CC3World so that nodes using the
 * same mesh model are drawn together, before moving on to other mesh models. This strategy
 * can minimize the number of mesh switches in the GL engine, which improves performance. 
 *
 * CC3MeshModel is an abstract class. Subclasses can be created for loading and managing
 * meshes from different sources and third-party libraries.
