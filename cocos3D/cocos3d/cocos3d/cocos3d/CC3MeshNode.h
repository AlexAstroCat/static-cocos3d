/**
 * A CC3Node that draws a 3D mesh model.
 * This class forms the base of all visible 3D mesh models in the 3D world.
 *
 * CC3MeshNode is a type of CC3Node, and will often participate in a structural
 * node assembly. An instance can be the child of another node, and the mesh node
 * itself can have child nodes.
 *
 * CC3MeshNodes encapsulate a CC3MeshModel instance, and can also encapsulate either
 * a CC3Material instance, or a pure color. The CC3MeshModel instance contains the
 * mesh vertex data. The CC3Material instance describes the material and texture
 * properties covering the mesh, which are affected by lighting conditions.
 * Alternately, instead of a material, the mesh may be colored by a single pure color
 * via the pureColor property.
 *
 * When this node is drawn, it delegates to the mesh model instance to render the mesh
 * vertices. If a material is defined, before drawing the mesh, it delegates to the
 * material to configure the covering of the mesh. If no material is defined, the node
 * establishes its pure color before rendering the mesh. The pure color is only used
 * if the node has no material attached. And the pure color may in turn be overridden
 * by the mesh data if vertex coloring is in use.
 *
 * Each CC3MeshNode can have only one material or pure color. For large, complicated
 * meshes that are covered by more than one material, or colored with more than one
 * color, the mesh must be broken into smaller meshes, each of which are covered by
 * a single material or color. These smaller sub-meshes are sometimes referred to as
 * "vertex groups". Each such sub-mesh is then wrapped in its own CC3MeshNode instance,
 * along with the material that covers that sub-mesh.
 *
 * These CC3MeshNode instances can then be added as child nodes to a single parent
 * CC3Node instance. This parent CC3Node can then be moved, rotated and scaled,
 * and all of its child nodes will transform in sync. The assembly will behave and
 * be seen as a single object.
 *
 * When the mesh model is set in the meshModel property, the CC3MeshNode instance
 * creates and builds a CC3NodeBoundingVolume instance from the mesh data, and
 * sets it into its boundingVolume property. 
 *
 * When a copy is made of a CC3MeshNode instance using the copy method, a copy is
 * made of the material, but the mesh model is simply assigned by reference, and
 * is not copied. The result is that the the new and original nodes will have
 * different materials, but will share the same mesh model. This design avoids
 * creating multiple copies of volumnious and static mesh data when creating
 * copies of nodes.
 *
 * Normally, the front faces of a mesh are displayed, and the back faces are culled
 * and not displayed. You can change this behaviour if you need to be changing the
 * values of the shouldCullFrontFaces and shouldCullBackFaces properties. An example
 * might be if you wanted to show the back-side of a planar sign, or if you wanted
 * to show the inside faces of a skybox.
 *
 * However, be aware that culling is a significant performance-improving technique.
 * You should avoid disabling backface culling except where specifically needed for
 * visual effect. And when you do, if you only need the back faces, turn on front
 * face culling for that mesh by setting the shouldCullFrontFaces property to YES.

 * the same way the front faces do, and will appear luminated by light that falls on the
 * front face, much like a stained-glass window. This may not be the affect that you are after,
 * and for some lighting conditions, instead of disabling back face culling, you might consider
 * creating a second textured front face, placed back-to-back with the original front face.
