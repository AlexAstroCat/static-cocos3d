/**
 * CC3Node and its subclasses form the basis of all 3D artifacts in the 3D world, including
 * visible meshes, structures, cameras, lights, resources, and the 3D world itself.
 *
 * Nodes can be moved, rotated and scaled. Rotation can be specified via either Euler angles
 * or quaternions.
 *
 * Nodes can be assembled in a structural hierarchy of parents and children, and transformations
 * that are applied to a node are also applied to its descendant nodes. Typically, the root
 * of a structural node hierarchy is an instance of CC3World.
 *
 * Each node is automatically touched at two distinct times during animation frame handling.
 * First, the updateBeforeTransform: and updateAfterTransform: methods are each invoked during
 * scheduled model state updating, before and after the transformation matrix of the node is
 * rebuilt, respectively. You should override udpateBeforeTransform: method to make any changes
 * to the node, or its child nodes.
 * 
 * You should override updateAfterTransform: only if you need to make use of the global
 * properties of the node or its child nodes, such as globalLocation, globalRotation, or
 * globalScale. These properties are valid only after the transformMatrix has been
 * calculated, and are therefore not valid within the updateBeforeTransform: method.
 * However, if you make any changes to the transform properties (location, rotation, scale)
 * of a node within the updateAfterTransform: method, you must invoke the updateTransformMatrices
 * method on that node in order to have the changes applied to the node's transformMatrix.
 * 
 * Note that you do NOT need to invoke the updateTransformMatrices method for any changes
 * made in the updateBeforeTransform: method, since those changes will automatically be
 * applied to the transformMatrix.
 *
 * The second place a node is touched is, the drawWithVisitor: method, which is automaticaly
 * invoked during each frame rendering cycle. You should have no need to override this method.
 * 
 * To maximize throughput, the operations of updating model state should be kept
 * separate from the operations of frame rendering, and the two should not be mixed.
 * Subclasses should respect this design pattern when overriding behaviour. Drawing
 * operations should not be included in state updating, and vice versa. Since OpenGL is
 * a hardware-accelerated state-machine pipeline, this separation allows frame-drawing
 * operations to be performed by the GPU at the same time that state update operations for
 * the next frame are being handled by the CPU, and on some systems, permits frame drawing
 * and model updating to be perfomed on separate threads.
 *
 * CC3Nodes support the cocos2d CCAction class hierarchy. Nodes can be translated, rotated,
 * and scaled in three dimensions, or made to point towards a direction (for cameras and
 * lights), all under control of cocos2d CCActions. As with other CCActions, these actions
 * can be combined into action sequences or repeating actions, or modified with cocos2d
 * ease actions. See the class CC3TransformTo and its subclasses for actions that operate
 * on CC3Nodes.
 *
 * When populating your world, you can easily create hordes of similar nodes using the copy
 * and copyWithName: methods. Those methods effect deep copies to allow each copy to be
 * manipulated independently, but will share underlying mesh data for efficient memory use.
 * See the notes at the copy method for more details about copying nodes.
 *
 * You can animate this class with animation data held in a subclass of CC3NodeAnimation.
 * To animate this node using animation data, set the animation property to an instance of
 * a subclass of the abstract CC3NodeAnimation class, populated with animation data, and
 * then create an instance of a CC3Animate action, and run it on this node.
 *
 * To maximize GL throughput, all OpenGL ES 1.1 state is tracked by the singleton instance
 * [CC3OpenGLES11Engine engine]. CC3OpenGLES11Engine only sends state change calls to the
 * GL engine if GL state really is changing. It is critical that all changes to GL state
 * are made through the CC3OpenGLES11Engine singleton. When adding or overriding functionality
 * in this framework, do NOT make gl* function calls directly if there is a corresponding
 * state change tracker in the CC3OpenGLES11Engine singleton. Route the state change request
 * through the CC3OpenGLES11Engine singleton instead.

 * 
 * The following rules are applied when copying a node:
 *   - The tag property is not copied. The tag is property is assigned and automatically
 *     generated unique tag value.
 *   - The copy will initially have no parent. It will automatically be set when this
 *     node is added as a child to a parent node.
 *   - Copies are created of all child nodes, using the copy method of each child. The
 *     child nodes of the new node will therefore have the same names as the child nodes
 *     of the original node.
 *   - Mesh data is copied by reference, not by value. Child nodes that support mesh data
 *     will assign it by reference when that child is copied. Mesh data is shared between
 *     both the original mesh node and copy node.
 * 
 * Subclasses that extend content should honour the deep copy design pattern, making
 * exceptions only for content that is both large and not subject to modifications,
 * such as mesh data.
 *
 * This method may often be used to duplicate a node many times, to create large number of
 * similar instances to populate a game. To help you verify that you are correctly releasing

 *   - has content to draw (as indicated by the hasLocalContent property)
 *   - intersects the camera's frustum (which is checked by invoking the method
 *     doesIntersectFrustum: of this node with the frustum from the visitor).
 *
 * If all of these tests pass, drawing is required, and this method transforms and draws
 * the local content of this node.
 *
 * If this node is visible and the visitor indicates that children should also be drawn,
 * this method then passes this notificaton along to the child nodes.
 *
 * As described in the class documentation, in keeping with best practices, drawing and frame
 * rendering should be kept separate from updating the model state. Therefore, when overriding
 * this method in a subclass (or any of the template methods invoked by this method), do not
 * update any model state. This method should perform only frame rendering operations.

 *
 * Culling nodes that are not visible to the camera is an important performance enhancement.
 * The node should strive to be as accurate as possible in returning whether it intersects
 * the camera's frustum. Incorrectly returning YES will cause wasted processing within the
