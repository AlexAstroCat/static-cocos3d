/**
 * CC3Resource is a wrapper class around a resource structure loaded from a data file
 * containing 3D resources. It handles loading object data from files, and creating
 * CC3Nodes from that data.
 *
 * This is an abstract class. Specific subclasses will load files of specific types.
 *
 * Of the methods defined in this class, subclasses must override the primitive
 * template method loadFromFile:. Other methods defined by this class have been
 * implemented using this primitive method. As a result, subclasses do not need
 * to override any of the other methods defined by this class.
 *
 * Access to 3D data objects loaded from the file is through the nodes property,
 * which contains the root nodes of a structural 3D node assembly constructed from
 * the 3D data loaded from the file. Subclasses should ensure that the nodes array
 * property is fully populated upon successful completion of the loadFromFile: method.
 *
 * Subclasses should ensure that the loadFromFile: method sets the name property
 * of this instance to the name of the file, and returns whether the file was
 * successfully loaded.

 * Subclasses must override this method to perform the actual file loading,
