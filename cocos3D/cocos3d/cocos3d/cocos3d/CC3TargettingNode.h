/**
 * This is an abstract node class representing a 3D model node that can be pointed in
 * a particular direction, such as a camera or light. The node can be pointed in a
 * direction as an alternative to rotating the node.
 *
 * Instances can be targetted at another node, and can track that node as both the target
 * and this node move through the 3D world. For instance, if this targetting node was a
 * camera, it could be pointed at another node representing a car, and could track that
 * car as both the car or the camera were moved through the 3D world, always keeping the
 * car in the center of the camera's vision.
 *
 * There are three directions associated with a targetting node, and these appear as
 * properties in this class. The forwardDirection is the direction that the node is
 * pointing. This property can either be set directly, or indirectly by specifying a
 * targetLocation, or better yet, and actual target node, each of which are settable
 * properties on this node. It should be recognized that both target and targetLocation
 * are simply means to an end in setting the forwardDirection.
 *
 * But pointing the node in a particualr direction does not completely define its
 * rotation in 3D space, because the node can be oriented in any rotation around the
 * axis along the forwardDirection vector (think of pointing a camera at a scene, and
 * then rotating the camera along the axis of its lens, landscape towards portrait).
 *
 * This is solved by specifying an additional upDirection, which fixes the rotation
 * around the forwardDirection by specifying which direction is considered to be 'up'.
 * This is further simplified by fixing a worldUpDirection, which does not need to
 * change. The local upDirection then becomes a read-only property calculated from
 * the combination of the forwardDirection, and the worldUpDirection.
 *
 * The third direction, the rightDirection, represents the direction that is 
 * "off to the right" if you were looking down the forwardDirection and 'up' was
 * the upDirection. The rightDirection is calculated from this. Although not really
 * needed, the rightDirection can be useful for some applications, and is provided
 * as a read-only property for completeness.
 *
 * The forwardDirection, upDirection and rightDirection form the orthagonal axes
 * of the local rotated coordinate system of the node.

 * it to point away from the targetLocation.
 *
 * When retrieving this property value, if the property was earlier explictly set,
 * it will be retrieved cleanly. However, if rotation was set by Euler angles,
 * quaternions, or forwardDirection, retriving the targetLocation comes with two
 * caveats. The first is that calculating a targetLocation requires the global
 * location of this node, which is only calculated when the node's transformMatrix
 * is calculated after all model updates have been processed. This means that the
 * calculated targetLocation will generally be one frame behind the real value.
 * The second caveat is that the targetLocation requires extrapolating the
 * forwardDirection out to an arbitrary invented point. This can sometimes
 * introduce higher calculation inaccuracies. In general, it is best to use this
 * property directly, both reading and writing it, rather than reading this 
 * property after setting one of the other rotational properties.

 * if the target property is set, this node will initially point to it, but will not
 * track it as it moves.
 *
 * If this property is set to YES, subsequently changing the value of the rotation,

 * quaternion or a set of Euler angles, and then read back as a fowardDirection, upDirection,

 * forwardDirection and worldUpDirection, and then read as a quaternion or a set of Euler angles.
