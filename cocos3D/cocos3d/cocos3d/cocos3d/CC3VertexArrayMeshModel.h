/**
 * A CC3VertexArrayMeshModel is a mesh model whose mesh data is kept in a set of
 * CC3VertexArrays instances. Each of the contained CC3VertexArray instances manages the
 * data for one aspect of the vertices (locations, normals, colors, texture mapping...).
 *
 * Vertex data can be interleaved into a single underlying memory buffer that is shared
 * between the contained CC3VertexArrays, or it can be separated into distinct memory
 * buffers for each vertex aspect.
 *
 * The only vertex array that is required is the vertexLocations property. The others are
 * optional, depending on the nature of the mesh. If the vertexIndices property is provided,
 * it will be used during drawing. Otherwise, the vertices will be drawn in linear order
 * as they appear in the vertexLocations property.
 *
 * When a copy is made of a CC3VertexArrayMeshModel instance, copies are not made of the
 * vertex arrays. Instead, they are retained by reference and shared between both the
 * original mesh model, and the new copy.
 *
 * CC3VertexArrayMeshModel manages data for one contiguous set of vertices that can be
 * drawn with a single call to the GL engine, or a single set of draw-strip calls to the
 * GL engine, using the same materail properties. To assemble a large, complex mesh
 * containing several distinct vertex groups, assign each vertex group to its own
 * CC3VertexArrayMeshModel instance, wrap each mesh model instance in a CC3MeshNode
 * instance, and create an structural assembly of the nodes. See the class notes for
 * CC3MeshNode for more information on assembling mesh nodes.
