/**
 * CC3VertexArray manages the data associated with an aspect of a vertex. CC3VertexArray
 * is an abstract implementation, and there are several sublcasses, each specialized to
 * manage the vertex data for a different vertex aspect (locations, normals, colors,
 * texture mapping, indices...).
 *
 * Each instance of a subclass of CC3VertexArray maintains a reference to the underlying
 * vertex data in memory, along with various parameters describing the underlying data,
 * such as its type, element size, stride, etc.
 *
 * The underlying data can be interleaved and shared by several CC3VertexArray subclasses,
 * each looking at a different aspect of the data for each vertex. In this case, the
 * elements property of each of those vertex array instances will reference the same
 * underlying data memory, and the elementOffset property of each CC3VertexArray instance
 * will indicate at which offset in each vertex data the datum of interest to that instance
 * is located.
 *
 * The CC3VertexArray instance also manages buffering the data to the GL engine, including
 * loading it into a server-side GL vertex buffer object (VBO) if desired. Once loaded into
 * the GL engine buffers, the underlying data can be released from the CC3VertexArray instance,
 * thereby freeing memory, by using the releaseRedundantData method.
 *
 * The CC3DrawableVertexArray abstract subclass adds the functionality to draw the vertex
 * data to the display through the GL engine.
 *
 * When drawing the vertices to the GL engine, each subclass remembers which vertices were
 * last drawn, and only binds the vertices to the GL engine when a different set of vertices
 * of the same type are drawn. This allows the application to organize the CC3MeshNodes
 * within the CC3World so that nodes using the same mesh vertices are drawn together, before
 * moving on to other meshes. This strategy can minimize the number of vertex pointer
 * switches in the GL engine, which improves performance.
