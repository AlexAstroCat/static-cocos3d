/**
 * CC3World is a CC3Node that manages a 3D scene.
 *
 * CC3World has the following responsibilities:
 *   - Acts as the root of the CC3Node structural assembly for the scene
 *   - Manages updating scene activity, including nodes, lights, and the camera
 *     based on a periodic animation trigger from the CC3Layer
 *   - Manages the drawing of the 3D artifacts to the GL engine
 *   - Manages the transition from 2D to 3D behaviour during each drawing frame
 *   - Manages the ordering of drawing of the 3D objects to maximize performance
 *   - facilitates user interaction with the world by interacting with UI events
 *     occuring in the CC3Layer controls
 *   - supports selection of 3D nodes via UI touch events
 *   - collects performance statistics
 *
 * When creating a 3D application, you will almost always create a subclass of
 * CC3World to define the control, features, and behaviour of your 3D world suitable
 * to your application. In your CC3World subclass, your will typically override one
 * or more of the following template methods:
 *
 *   - initializeWorld - assemble the objects of your 3D world, or load them from files.
 *
 *   - updateBeforeTransform: - periodically update the activity of your 3D world prior to
 *                              the automatic recalulation of the node's transformation
 *                              matrix, and prior to the automatic invoking the same method
 *                              on each of child node of this node.
 *
 *   - updateAfterTransform: - periodically update the activity of your 3D world after
 *                             the automatic recalulation of the node's transformMatrix
 *                             and prior to the automatic invoking the same method on each
 *                             of child node of this node.
 * 
 * In these methods, you can manipulate most nodes by setting their properties.
 * You can move and orient nodes using the node's location, rotation and scale
 * properties, and can show or hide nodes with the node's visible property.
 *
 * You should override the udpateBeforeTransform: method if you need to make changes to
 * the transform properties (location, rotation, scale), of any node. These changes will
 * them automatically be applied to the transformMatrix of the node and its child nodes.
 *
 * You should override the updateAfterTransform: method if you need access to the
 * global transform properties (globalLocation, globalRotation, globalScale), of a node
 * since these properties are only valid after the transformMatrix has been recalculated.
 * An example of where access to the global transform properties would be useful is in
 * the execution of collision detection algorithms.
 *
 * To access nodes in your world, you can use the method getNodeNamed: on the CC3World
 * (or any node). However, if you need to access the same node repeatedly, for example
 * to update it on every frame, it's highly recommended that you retrieve it once and
 * then cache it in an instance variable in your CC3World instance.
 *
 * By default, the initializeWorld, updateBeforeTransform:, and updateAfterTransform:
 * methods do nothing. Subclasses do not need to invoke this default superclass
 * implementations in the overridden methods. The updateBeforeTransform: and
 * updateAfterTransform: methods are defined in the CC3Node class.
 * See the documentation there.
 *
 * You must add at least one CC3Camera to your 3D world to make it viewable. This
 * camera may be added directly, or it may be added as part of a larger node assembly.
 * Regardless of the technique used to add cameras, the CC3World will take the first
 * camera added and automatically make it the activeCamera.
 *
 * The camera can also be used to project global locations within the 3D world onto
 * a 2D point on the screen view, and can be used to project 2D screen points onto
 * a ray or plane intersection within the 3D world. See the class notes of  CC3Camera
 * for more information on mapping between 3D and 2D locations.
 *
 * During drawing, the nodes can be traversed in the hierarchical order of the
 * node structural assembly, starting at the CC3World instance that forms the root node
 * of the node assembly. Alternately, and preferrably, the CC3World can use a
 * CC3NodeSequencer instance to arrange the nodes into a linear sequence, ordered and
 * grouped based on definable sorting priorities. This is beneficial, because it allows
 * the application to order and group drawing operations in ways that reduce the number
 * and scope of state changes within the GL engine, thereby improving performance and
 * throughput.
 * 
 * For example, when drawing, nodes could be grouped by the drawing sequencer so that
 * opaque objects are drawn prior to blended objects, and an application with many
 * objects that use the same material or mesh can be sorted so that nodes with like
 * materials or meshes are grouped together. It is highly recommended that you use a
 * CC3NodeSequencer, and this is the default configuration for CC3World instances.
 *
 * The CC3World maintains this drawing sequence separately from the hierarchical node
 * assembly. This allows the maintenance of the hierarchical parent-child relationships
 * for operations such as movement and transformations, while simultaneously enabling
 * more efficient drawing operations through node drawing sequencing.
 *
 * An instance of CC3World is held by an instance of CC3Layer, which is a subclass of
 * the cocos2d CCLayer class, and can participate with other cocos2d layers and CCNodes
 * in an overall cocos2d scene. During drawing, the CC3Layer delegates all 3D operations
 * to its CC3World instance. You will also typically create a subclass of CC3Layer that
 * is customized for your application. In most cases, you will add methods and state to
 * both your CC3World and CC3Layer subclasses to facilitate user interaction.
 *
 * The CC3Layer and CC3World can process touch events to select the 3D node visible under
 * the touch point. To enable touch selection of 3D nodes, set the isTouchEnabled property
 * of your customized CC3Layer to YES, and set the isTouchEnabled property to YES on any
 * node that you wish to be selectable via touch events. Subsequently, whenever a touch
 * event occurs, the callback method nodeSelected:byTouchEvent:at: will be invoked on your
 * customized CC3World instance. See the description of the nodeSelected:byTouchEvent:at:
 * method and the CC3Node isTouchEnabled property for useful hints about choosing which
 * nodes to enable for touch selection.
 *
 * Since the touch-move events are both voluminous and seldom used, the implementation
 * of ccTouchMoved:withEvent: has been left out of the default CC3Layer implementation.
 * To receive and handle touch-move events for object picking, copy the commented-out
 * ccTouchMoved:withEvent: template method implementation in CC3Layer to your customized
 * CC3Layer subclass.
 *
 * Depending on the complexity of the application, it may instantiate a single CC3World,
 * instance, or multiple instances if the application progresses from scene to scene.
 * Similarly, the application may have a single CC3Layer, or multiple CC3Layers.
 * Each CC3Layer may have its own CC3World instance, or may share a single instance.
 *
 * To maximize GL throughput, all OpenGL ES 1.1 state is tracked by the singleton instance
 * [CC3OpenGLES11Engine engine]. CC3OpenGLES11Engine only sends state change calls to the
 * GL engine if GL state really is changing. It is critical that all changes to GL state
 * are made through the CC3OpenGLES11Engine singleton. When adding or overriding functionality
 * in this framework, do NOT make gl* function calls directly if there is a corresponding
 * state change tracker in the CC3OpenGLES11Engine singleton. Route the state change request
 * through the CC3OpenGLES11Engine singleton instead.
 *
 * You can collect statistics about the performance of your cocos3d application by setting
 * the performanceStatistics property to an appropriate instance of a statistics collector.
 * By default, no statistics are collected. See the notes of the performanceStatistics
 * property for more information.

 * If the maxUpdateInterval property has been set, this method will clamp dt to that limit.
 * See the description of maxUpdateInterval for more information about clamping the update interval.

 *   -# Checks isRunning property of this instance, and exits immediately if not running.
 *   -# If needed, clamps the dt property to the value in maxUpdateInterval property.

 * to determine the 3D object under the touch point.
 *
 * This handler picks 3D nodes using a color picking algorithm. When a touch event occurs,
 * its type is added to the queue, and the touch position is updated. On the next rendering
 * pass, the 3D scene is rendered so that each 3D node has a unique color. The color of
